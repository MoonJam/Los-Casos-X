## Introduction
The socio-cultural phenomenon of UFO sightings has fascinated me since I could read. In fact, I'm fairly sure I read through all of the UFO books available at the Riverside Library as a newly literate boy in the early 1990s. A cursory exploration of the subculture's media reveals a consistent thread of knowing sighting data exist, but that the data are impossible to use or simply sit unused.

## Description
My main goal is to access, process and explore the data available from NUFORC. As time goes on, if I become aware of other related data I will try and incorporate it into the project. While I have some initial ideas for some machine learning models to employ in interesting ways with the data, I am going to hold off on committing to any particular goals until I have a handle on what's going on vis-a-vis those lights in the sky.

At this point, the actual accessing of the data is done through a web-scraper written in Python and the EDA is written in R. I've compiled my work thus far into R-Markdown/Markdown to keep things presentable.
