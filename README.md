# Los Casos X
## Introduction
The socio-cultural phenomenon of UFO sightings has fascinated me since I could read. In fact, I'm fairly sure I read through all of the UFO books available at the Riverside Library as a newly literate boy in the early 1990s. A cursory exploration of the subculture's media reveals a consistent thread of knowing data exists on the subject, but that the data are either impossible to use or simply sit unused.

## Description
My main goal is to access, process and explore the data available from NUFORC. As time goes on, if I become aware of other related data I will try and incorporate it into the project. While I have some initial ideas for some machine learning models to employ in interesting ways with the data, I am going to hold off on committing to any particular goals until I have a handle on what's going on vis-a-vis those lights in the sky.

At this point, this project consists of the following:

* A webscraper written in Python that pulls all available data from 1947 to present day from [www.nuforc.org](www.nuforc.org)
* A set of processing procedures written in a Python script that prepare the data for analysis/model-building.
* Exploratory data analysis conducted in R and rendered as a Markdown document for easy-consumption.
